# Vex Robotics 2017 "In the Zone" Simulation
A Cinder C++ based tool for simulating real world vex robotics applications

This simulation consists of 3 C++ built simulations, all having to do with robotics. The first simulation highlights the capabilities of my very own PID (proportional integral derivative) algorithm, which allows for smooth robotic mechanism control by comparing the error to the current state. The second simulation demonstrates a logarithmic remapping functions I used for a smooth acceleration curve on the robot base to not stress the motors. Lastly, my final simulation was a complete VEX game simulation that took in realistic game situations and visuals to create a playable 2017 VEX "In The Zone" match. This project allowed me to run tests and design strategies for a conceptual robot without needing physical access to the robot. 

This project was built on the Windows platform with Cinder C++. For further developmental questions please contact me here as this project is currently archived since my VEX robotics days are over.
