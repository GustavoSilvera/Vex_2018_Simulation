# Vex Robotics 2017-18 "In the Zone" Simulation
A Cinder C++ based tool for simulating real world VEX robotics applications

This simulation consists of several C++ built simulations, all having to do with robotics. The first simulation highlights the capabilities of my team's PID (proportional integral derivative) algorithm, which allows for smooth robotic mechanism control by comparing the error to the current state. The second simulation demonstrates a logarithmic remapping functions we used for a smooth acceleration curve on the robot base to destress the motors. Lastly, my final simulation is a complete VEX game simulation that took in realistic game situations and visuals to create a playable 2017-18 VEX "In The Zone" match. This project allowed our team to run tests and design strategies for a conceptual robot without needing physical access to the robot. 

This project was built on the Windows 10 platform with Cinder C++. For further developmental questions do contact me as this project is currently archived since my VEX robotics days are over.
