# Vex Robotics 2017 "In the Zone" Simulation
A Cinder C++ based tool for simulating real world vex robotics applications

Essentially this is a fully C++ built Vex robotics simulation making use of the open source Cinder C++ graphics libraries. 
There are currently 4 Simulations on this build, one demonstrating the potential of a complete PID (proportional integral derivative) loop, another showing my own truSpeed logarithmic remapping functions which can be found on desmos, another for the robot itself to calculate its own position and direction based off real world sensorvalues (not working as of this build), and the final is a COMPLETE vex 2017 "In the Zone" field simulation with real world physics and scaled gameplay with a goal of being able to test our real world autons and perhaps use machine learning to train itself and create its own. 

This project is currently still in development, and I'm working hard to fix many bugs but as of this version its still a very useable tool for anyone wanting to dabble with basic robotics simulations, and contribute. 

Some prerequisites: understanding of the C++ programming language, use of Cinder (https://libcinder.org/), and basic understanding of Visual Studios which is necessary to build and compile the project.

I currently am the only contributor and maintainer of this project, but feel free to pull it and contribute (help would be greatly appreciated :D )
